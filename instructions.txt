INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THIS SIMPLE FEEDFORWARD SALES MODEL NEURAL NETWORK FOR YOUR DATASET AND ECONOMIC INDICATOR
The base call is from the baseCall.py file. THis is where you will put your custom parameters in
This leads directly into the test.py file. This executes two methods.
These two methods are located in the same directory called addMonthsYearAlgo.py and salesAlgorithm.py
I also utilize a pkl and csv file, recording the results on a file called predicted_sales.csv
